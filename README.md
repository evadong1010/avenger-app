### Accept Customer
Accept Customer is the new name for Hosted CIM, part of our [Customer Profiles API](http://developer.authorize.net/api/reference/features/customer_profiles.html)

1. Incorporate the Manage Customer hosted page into your application (Profiles tab).

3. Pop up the hosted "Add/Edit Shipping" page in a light-box mode (Shipping tab).  
  
  
### Accept.js
Accept.js is a new integration option which allows you to leverage the full power of the Authorize.Net API while avoiding the PCI burden of credit card information hitting your servers.  See our [developer documentation](http://developer.authorize.net/api/reference/features/acceptjs.html) for more details.
